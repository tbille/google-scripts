# Written Interview 2 GitHub

This script will read your emails and create a GitHub issue for all emails that matches this expression: `"from:no-reply@greenhouse.io AND subject:'A candidate submitted a take home test for' NOT label:Processed"`.

The script creates an issue assigned to the token owner, attaches to a ZenHub Epic and adds an estimation of 2. Once the email is processed, the label `Processed` is added to the email.
